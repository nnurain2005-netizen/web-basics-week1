# Web Basics – Week 1

## How the Web Works

The web works using a client-server model. When a user opens a website,
the browser (client) sends a request to a server through the internet.
The server then responds with the requested resources such as HTML,
CSS, JavaScript files, or data.

## HTTP & HTTPS
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for communication between
clients and servers. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP where data
is encrypted to protect user information.

## Client vs Server
The client is the user’s device and browser that requests information.
The server is a computer that stores website data and sends responses
back to the client.

## Frontend vs Backend
Frontend is the part of the website that users see and interact with.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend handles data processing, databases, and authentication.

## Git & GitHub
Git is a version control system used to track changes in code.
GitHub is an online platform to store and manage Git repositories.
